									<p>Over the years, the procedure to evaluate the desertification phenomenon has undergone a profound transformation, moving from a simple
indication of the progress degree of sandy deserts to a holistic and synoptic view of the issue. In this way, the term desertification has been used
to identify an extremely more complex and fuller concept, proposed by the United Nations to combat desertification (UNCCD) in 1996. In this
aspect, it highlights the "degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and sub-dry humid" due to the interaction of "physical, biological, political, social,
cultural and economic factors". These huge amounts of phenomenon triggering causes are grouped into two main categories: anthropogenic
pressure and climatic alterations. Therefore, Central-Southern Italy, subjected to both of them, is particularly vulnerable to the desertification
phenomenon.</p>
									<p>Although such phenomenon was investigated deeply, a proper model to evaluate it in various environmental contexts is still missed. Therefore,
EO4Des is aimed at: i) defining the most relevant variables affecting the desertification process in various environmental contexts (urban, coastal
and agricultural) by downscaling the World Atlas of Desertification (WAD) results; ii) exploring the potentiality of geospatial big data, and in
particular of the just-launched new satellite missions, in assessing such a phenomenon; iii) developing automatic tools using open-source cloud
computing platform; iv) implementing a WebGIS application devoted to project outcomes dissemination as well as support end-usersâ€™ decisions.
The developed methodology will be tested in Puglia and Sicily</p>

									<p>Because of topic complexity and multidisciplinary, the project team was designed to have all the necessary skills to achieve the above-mentioned
goals. Lead by Politecnico di Bari (Scientific Referent: Eufemia Tarantino, Full Professor in Geomatics), the project will involve University of
Salento (Scientific Referent: Antonio Leone, Full Professor in Territorial Planning) and University of Catania (Scientific Referent: Giuseppe
Mussumeci, Associate Professor in Geomatics). Each of them will coordinate specific activities albeit they will interact with the other partners to
guarantee maximum cooperation and communication fluidity</p>
									<p>EO4Des will strongly impact on both the scientific community and potential end-users/stakeholders. Indeed, its results will be disseminated
through ISI-SCOPUS publications, as well as national and international conferences and the WebGIS platform implementation.</p>
