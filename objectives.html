												<p>The key source to investigate the desertification phenomenon is the massive availability of geospatial big data. They involve Earth Observation
(EO) data collected by satellite platforms managed by space agencies, such as Landsat from US NASA, Copernicus with Sentinels from EU,
Copernicus Contributing Missions, Planet, and geospatial data provided by local, national, and international portals, as Copernicus services,
OpenStreetMap, Inspire Geoportal, Geoportal Nazionale of the Italian Ministry of the Environment. Since all these data are multi-sources, multivariables, and multi-scales, a new approach suitable for examining and combining them is essential, allowing retrieving useful information suitable
for understanding the desertification. Nevertheless, they are not enough to investigate "slow" phenomena, like the one under investigation in this
research, and to develop reliable services for end-users to analyze its past and future evolution. Thus, to take advantage of such data, two key
aspects should be considered: i) the computing infrastructure required to store and handle them and ii) the algorithms needed to produce
information</p>
											<p>The first issue was faced in the last few years thanks to the introduction of cloud computing environments, like Google Earth Engine (GEE),
realized by Google in 2017. GEE was developed to handle geospatial big data exploiting many processors to run customized algorithms
simultaneously. This results in speeding the process up considerably, removing the inconvenience linked to data storage, processing, and
analysis. Moreover, it integrates a daily-updated catalog. However, to date, the main problem is linked to the lack of algorithms suitable for
extracting desertification information from the continuously coming massive amount of EO data. To meet such a purpose, In-dex-based
approaches, as well as Machine Learning (ML) methods, can be mixed to extract the needed information and implement proper services.
On the whole, Earth Observation for Desertification (EO4Des) is an innovative project in comparison to the state-of-the-art of desertification,
because it will address the following objectives (OBJ), leading to corresponding results (RES):</p>	
												<h3>OBJ-1 [Scientific]: Investigation of EO big data capabilities to assess the desertification phenomenon and evolution (RES-1) </h3>
<h3>OBJ-2 [Scientific]: Development of a novel, automatic methodology for desertification analysis, exploiting the most advanced satellite missions
(RES-2)</h3>
<h3>OBJ-3 [Technical]: Development of proper codes to implement such methodology in a free and open-source software based on cloud computing
infrastructure (RES-3)</h3>
<h3>OBJ-4 [Technical]: Development of a WebGIS platform aimed at storing and disseminating input and output data (RES-4)</h3>
<h3>OBJ-5 [Governance]: Application and validation of the developed codes on three relevant thematic areas (urban - RES-5.1, agricultural areas -
RES-5.2, coastline - RES-5.3)</h3>
