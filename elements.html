												<h3>State of the art</h3>
												<p>The term desertification has undergone a deep evolution over time. Originally, it was associated with sandy deserts expansion, and, only in the
last few years, it was used to indicate a much more complex issue due to the mutual interaction of "physical, biological, political, social, cultural
and economic factors" responsible for determining "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas" (UNCCD, 1996 - article 1a).
Desertification, therefore, occurs when land and water resources are degraded under certain threshold values, leading to the onset of irreversible
changes as well as an undesirable new state. Nevertheless, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has grouped the
above-mentioned causes into two main categories: "Climate Changes (CC)" and " anthropogenic activities".</p>
											<p>.
The zones exposed to strong anthropogenic pressure and intense climatic stress, such as those located in Central and/or Southern Italy, are
characterized by a high intrinsic vulnerability to desertification. Thus, the territories affected by such a phenomenon are fragile ecosystems,
typified by extremely poor productive soils due to the lack of organic matter. Identifying and adopting adequate land management strategies aimed
at promoting sustainability and improving ecosystem services is essential to deal with soil deterioration. Despite this, because of the absence of a
universally accepted methodological framework of "what and how to measure", the implemented actions showed ambiguous and ineffective
results. Consequently, in recent years, the European Union is pushing its Member States to identify potential areas vulnerable to desertification, to
improve and downscale the knowledge provided by the World Atlas of Desertification (WAD) realized in 2019.</p>	
												<p>Tackling the desertification phenomenon implies two diverse aspects treatment: i) detection of the most relevant factors triggering desertification at
local scale and ii) definition of the optimal technique to estimate them and to assess the corresponding risk. To date, the commonly used indicators
are responsible for describing the relationships among the various factors as well as depicting the phenomenon advancement clearly. Although the
first parameters date back to the 1970s, the real turning point was in 1998 when Rubio and Bochet proposed a detailed list of criteria to select and
assess the most suitable indicators within the "MEDALUS III" European project. Their main objectives concerned variables definition and the
development of a composite index to identify Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA). Although the proposed methodology has been applied for
longer, it was not exhaustive since it did not involve social and economic components, i.e., growing population rate and density. In addition, such
indicators depended on environmental context and, therefore, site-specific studies were carried out. Fierotti and Zanchi (1998) proposed soil
erosion as a global indicator albeit its application is limited to hilly areas in Mediterranean Region. To extend its usage, it may be integrated with
peculiar indicators for plains, such as vegetation cover and productivity, soil physical characteristics, and amount of organic matter. In any case,
these parameters cannot be separated from field observations. Conversely, organic matter degradation, soil erosion, and salinization were selected as descriptors in sub-humid, arid, semi-arid, and dry areas within the EC ENVASSO project. The DESIRE project (2012), instead,
investigated the most important parameters for evaluating soil degradation and desertification processes on a global scale. </p>
												<p>The need to investigate the unleashed causes and the dominant factors is still challenging. Additionally, such parameters cannot be measured
through conventional approaches, based on field data, as they are invasive and destructive as well as expensive in terms of acquisition and
processing time. Conversely, Remote Sensing (RS) technique has proved to be much more suitable to face the problem. RS is a cost-effective,
non-destructive tool that allows obtaining repeatable results on a large scale. It can provide multispectral, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal data
that enable monitoring and assessment of environmental changes. To meet such purposes, Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites were commonly applied. MODIS showed better results than Landsat thanks to the presence of the
hyperspectral sensor albeit its products are not satisfying because of its low spatial resolution (1 km). Such outcomes could be improved thanks to
the adoption of the most advanced satellite images, characterized by higher spatial and spectral resolution as well as a higher number of bands,
i.e., Landsat 9, PRISMA, PlanetScope, etc. Nevertheless, a large amount of data should be handled and, thus, cloud platforms appear like the
optimal alternative to manage them saving time and cost.</p>

												<h3>Project aim</h3>
												<p>The desertification phenomenon is a dynamic process that is strongly affected by anthropogenic pressure and intense climatic stress triggering, in
this way, complex soil degradation issues. For this reason, although it was analyzed deeply over the years, its evaluation is still challenging.</p>
												<p>Therefore, EO4Des is aimed at filling such a gap by achieving the following goals:</p>
												<p>i) to define the most relevant variables affecting the desertification process in various environmental contexts (urban, coastal and agricultural). This
will result in WAD results downscaling;</p>
												<p>ii) to explore the potentiality of geospatial big data, and in particular of the just-launched new satellite missions, in assessing such phenomenon;</p>
												<p>iii) to develop automatic tools using open-source cloud computing platforms;</p>
												<p>iv) to implement a WebGIS application devoted to project outcomes dissemination as well as support end-users decisions.</p>
												<p>So, this project has the ambitious aim to reply to the unsolved question of "what and how to measure" as well as contextualize the answer to
specific environmental sites in the Mediterranean area.</p>
