												<h3>Objectives</h3>
												<p>The key source to investigate the desertification phenomenon is the massive availability of geospatial big data. They involve Earth Observation
(EO) data collected by satellite platforms managed by space agencies, such as Landsat from US NASA, Copernicus with Sentinels from EU,
Copernicus Contributing Missions, Planet, and geospatial data provided by local, national, and international portals, as Copernicus services,
OpenStreetMap, Inspire Geoportal, Geoportal Nazionale of the Italian Ministry of the Environment. Since all these data are multi-sources, multivariables, and multi-scales, a new approach suitable for examining and combining them is essential, allowing retrieving useful information suitable
for understanding the desertification. Nevertheless, they are not enough to investigate "slow" phenomena, like the one under investigation in this
research, and to develop reliable services for end-users to analyze its past and future evolution. Thus, to take advantage of such data, two key
aspects should be considered: i) the computing infrastructure required to store and handle them and ii) the algorithms needed to produce
information</p>
											<p>The first issue was faced in the last few years thanks to the introduction of cloud computing environments, like Google Earth Engine (GEE),
realized by Google in 2017. GEE was developed to handle geospatial big data exploiting many processors to run customized algorithms
simultaneously. This results in speeding the process up considerably, removing the inconvenience linked to data storage, processing, and
analysis. Moreover, it integrates a daily-updated catalog. However, to date, the main problem is linked to the lack of algorithms suitable for
extracting desertification information from the continuously coming massive amount of EO data. To meet such a purpose, In-dex-based
approaches, as well as Machine Learning (ML) methods, can be mixed to extract the needed information and implement proper services.
On the whole, Earth Observation for Desertification (EO4Des) is an innovative project in comparison to the state-of-the-art of desertification,
because it will address the following objectives (OBJ), leading to corresponding results (RES):</p>	
												<p>OBJ-1 [Scientific]: Investigation of EO big data capabilities to assess the desertification phenomenon and evolution (RES-1) </p>
<p></p>OBJ-2 [Scientific]: Development of a novel, automatic methodology for desertification analysis, exploiting the most advanced satellite missions
(RES-2)</p>
<p>OBJ-3 [Technical]: Development of proper codes to implement such methodology in a free and open-source software based on cloud computing
infrastructure (RES-3)</p>
<p>OBJ-4 [Technical]: Development of a WebGIS platform aimed at storing and disseminating input and output data (RES-4)</p>
<p>OBJ-5 [Governance]: Application and validation of the developed codes on three relevant thematic areas (urban - RES-5.1, agricultural areas -
RES-5.2, coastline - RES-5.3)</p>

												<h3> Methodology and expected results</h3>
							<h3>OBJ-1 [Scientific]: Exploration of EO big data capabilities (RES-1)</h3>
	<p>All the available data provided by space agencies and local, national, and international portals will be gathered and processed in order to explore
their potentiality in assessing the desertification phenomenon in different environmental contexts, such as coastal, urban, and agricultural areas.
Desertification is strongly dependent on external conditions and, therefore, a proper dataset will be detected for each territorial context and tested
on the corresponding Area Of Interest (AOI). This leads to the development of the best practices to be implemented in all analyzed areas and,
mainly, in the evaluation of the benefits introduced by the adoption of the most recent satellite images (Landsat 9, PRISMA, Planet, etc.). This
project is not just intended in improving desertification knowledge and in developing an automatic innovative methodology to assess and monitor
such a process but also in testing the potentialities of the new satellite images.
EO big data quality and potentialities will be checked step-by-step by applying traditional methods and introducing new indices, developed ad hoc
to meet such purpose.</p>
<h3>OBJ-2 [Scientific]: Desertification analysis methodology (RES-2)</h3>
<p>The development of proper codes aimed at defining desertification risk in different environmental contexts automatically is still challenging. This is
mainly due to the dependence of this phenomenon on Earth's surface characteristics, the huge amount of needed data to assess it, and, lastly,
technological limitations. In recent years, new generation satellite missions equipped with innovative sensors from spectral and spatial resolution
points of view have been introduced. Developing novel satellite data processing by using most of them, such as PlanetScope and Landsat 9
(launched in September 2021) and PRISMA, have not been explored to estimate desertification variables yet.</p>
	
<p>Therefore, after investigating the most suitable variables to detect the desertification phenomenon in various environmental contexts and
analyzing the most suitable satellite imagery characteristics to extract such information, conventional models will be implemented to test their
performance and to point out their limitations. Both pixel-based and object-based approaches will be investigated. Indeed, several indices
introduced to extract specific land use/land cover categories will be applied and the corresponding outcomes will be analyzed to detect their pros
and cons. On the basis of this information, newly adapted indices will be proposed. However, this method does not give the possibility to fully
exploit a large number of spectral bands available in multi and hyperspectral images and, for this reason, multivariate statistical approaches, which
go beyond the univariate statistical technique limits, will be performed too. Specifically, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), recognized as a
promising option, will be tested too. The usefulness and goodness-of-fit of PLSR models will be performed by Residual Predictive Deviation
(RPD), calculated as the ratio between the Standard Deviation (SD) of the reference dataset and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). There is
not a specific statistical rule for setting the RPD thresholds and, for this reason, the commonly used classification in literature will be adopted. It
involves three levels of classification: RPD < 3 is not useful because it means low predictive power; RPD > 3 is suitable for screening; RPD > 5 is suitable for detecting the accurate analysis (laboratory analysis). On the contrary, the quality assessment of the indices will be achieved by
calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE. According to classification suggested in literature, three classes will be distinguished:</p>
												
<p>i) strong correlation: R2 > 0.7; </p>
<p>ii) moderate correlation: 0.5 < R2 < 0.7; </p>
	<p>iii) weak correlation: R2 < 0.5. </p>
	<p>Lastly, a proper rule-based model, based
on the combination of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, will be also developed and tested.
After detecting the best technique to quantify all variables affecting the desertification phenome-non, the multi-temporal information will be
extracted by applying the change detection technique. The outcomes of such a procedure will be assessed and refined using the available
benchmarks dataset (acquired during the collection step).</p>
<h3>OBJ-3 [Technical]: Free and open-source software (RES-3)</h3>
<p>Proper Javascript codes will be developed in GEE, a cloud-free open-source computing platform for geospatial big data treatment realized by
Google. GEE integrates a data catalog, daily updated with nearly 6000 publicly available geospatial datasets belonging to active missions. Such
data may be consulted by users through the Application Programming Interface (API). In addition, it also gives the opportunity to upload and
process own data. Contrary to desktop software, its usage brings out more benefits. Firstly, involving many processors in running the scripts, the
process is speeds up significantly, and the problems linked to the storage, the processing, and the analysis of a large volume of geospatial data
are cleaned out. This results in the possibility to extract the results in a short time and increment the number of tests to perform. Then, GEE is
more flexible, and it allows the implementation of own codes, adapted to meet users’ needs. Nevertheless, this framework is still in progress and,
consequently, the most of existing algorithms have not been implemented yet. Thus, using GEE allows customizing existing algorithms and
developing new automatic ones for free. Lastly, the application of Free and Open-Source Software for Geographic information systems (FOSS4G)
is perfectly in line with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and EU directive INSPIRE	</p>
	
<h3>OBJ-4 [Technical]: WebGIS platform development (RES-4)</h3>
<p>In accordance with the standards proposed by OGC and EU directive INSPIRE, FOSS4G will be also used to implement the WebGIS
configuration, developed on the operative pipeline proposed by Huxhold and Levinsohm (1995). Such a workflow consists of six main steps, each
of which should be considered as an interactive and iterative process. Firstly, the potential end-users and required data to meet the research
purpose will be identified. This information, thus, will be used to design the WebGIS application configuration and structure, subsequently
implemented in a pilot project, whose quality and performance will be further evaluated. Lastly, once the optimal quality is achieved, the real
framework will be launched</p>
<p>The WebGIS will be structured in three tiers: the first level (interface) will be dedicated to data presentation, while the second one will be devoted
to the analysis module and, lastly, the third ti-er will be aimed at storing and handling the data. An adequate infrastructure, based on FOSS4G, will
be developed for each tier. This allowed generating three independent modules.
WebGIS application is essential since it allows disseminating projects results as well as supporting potential end-users and stakeholders in
detecting the optimal strategies to face desertification issues.</p>
<h3>OBJ-5 [Governance]: Applications</h3>
	<p>The project methodology will be tested on different Areas Of Interest (AOIs) that will be selected with the panel of end-users and stakeholders, set
in the first step of EO4Des. Specifically, different environmental contexts, such as urban, agricultural, and coastal areas, will be considered. Such
a choice will be taken in order to define the optimal methodology for all types of landscapes since the desertification phenomenon is strongly
influenced by the environmental contexts. Additionally, such sites will be selected both in Sicily and Puglia regions in order to test and validate the
developed methodology in two different locations and extend their effectiveness in all Mediterranean zone.
After defining the case studies, stakeholders and end-users will be continuously involved during the project to consider their needs as well as
implement their suggestions and feedback. This will result in the production of useful information that will support all potential users in making the
right decisions to face the desertification in specific sites.</p>
